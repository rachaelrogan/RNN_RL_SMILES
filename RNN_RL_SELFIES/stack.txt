    - problem with  tf_process_dir=tf_process_dir_,freeze=False)
72 - in train_model definition
    - problem with map_location=lambda storage, loc: storage))


- in train_model definition, we create transfer_model, which is an RNN as defined
in model.py.
- in model.py, the RNN is self.rnn = MultiGRU, which is also defined in model.py
- MultiGRU is defined with PyTorch with voc_size as the input dimension

Takeaway: voc_size is really important

- make sure that we are reading from all the proper files
- make sure that there are no unnecessary newlines in the mols.smi
